    "# PDF Summarization with Indexify and Mistral\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we'll explore how to create a PDF summarization pipeline using Indexify and Mistral's large language models. By the end of the document, you should have a pipeline capable of ingesting 1000s of PDF documents, and using Mistral for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The summarization pipeline is going to be composed of two steps -\n",
    "- PDF to Text extraction. We are going to use a pre-built extractor for this - `tensorlake/pdfextractor`.\n",
    "- We use Mistral for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a virtual env with Python 3.9 or later\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  python3.9 -m venv ve\n",
    "  source ve/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- `pip` (Python package manager)\n",
    "- A Mistral API key\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python and command-line interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Indexify\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install Indexify using the official installation script in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl https://getindexify.ai | sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the Indexify server:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./indexify server -d\n",
    "```\n",
    "This starts a long running server that exposes ingestion and retrieval APIs to applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Required Extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll install the necessary extractors in a new terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install indexify-extractor-sdk\n",
    "indexify-extractor download tensorlake/pdfextractor\n",
    "indexify-extractor download tensorlake/mistral\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the extractors are downloaded, you can start them:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "indexify-extractor join-server\n",
    "```"

    "## Customization and Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the summarization process by modifying the `system_prompt` in the extraction graph. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To generate bullet-point summaries:\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  system_prompt: 'Summarize the following text as a list of bullet points:'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To focus on specific aspects of the document:\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  system_prompt: 'Summarize the main arguments and supporting evidence from the following text:'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also experiment with different Mistral models by changing the `model_name` parameter to find the best balance between speed and accuracy for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While the example might look simple, there are some unique advantages of using Indexify for this -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalable and Highly Availability**: Indexify server can be deployed on a cloud and it can process 1000s of PDFs uploaded into it, and if any step in the pipeline fails it automatically retries on another machine.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: You can use any other [PDF extraction model](https://docs.getindexify.ai/usecases/pdf_extraction/) we used here doesn't work for the document you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn more about Indexify on our docs - https://docs.getindexify.ai\n",
    "- Learn how to use Indexify and Mistral for [entity extraction from PDF documents](../pdf-entity-extraction/)"
