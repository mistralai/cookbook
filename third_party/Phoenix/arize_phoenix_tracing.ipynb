    "- Use Mistral's [tool calling feature](https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/function-calling/) to perform structured data extraction: the task of transforming unstructured input (e.g., user requests in natural language) into structured format (e.g., tabular format),\n",
    "- Instrument your Mistral AI client to record trace data in [OpenInference tracing](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) format,\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful feature of the Mistral AI chat completions API is tool calling, wherein a user describes the signature and arguments of one or more tools to the Mistral AI API via a JSON Schema and natural language descriptions, and the LLM decides when to use each tool and provides argument values depending on the context of the conversation. In addition to its primary purpose of integrating function inputs and outputs into a sequence of chat messages, tool calling is also useful for structured data extraction, since you can specify a \"function\" that describes the desired format of your structured output. Structured data extraction is useful for a variety of purposes, including ETL or as input to another machine learning model such as a recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's possible to produce structured output without using tool calling via careful prompting, tool calling is more reliable at producing output that conforms to a particular format. For more details on Mistral AI's tool calling API, see the [Mistral AI documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/function-calling/).\n",
