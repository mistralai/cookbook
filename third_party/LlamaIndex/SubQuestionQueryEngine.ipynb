    "# Sub-Question Query Engine with Mistral AI and LlamaIndex \n",
    "\n",
    "A `VectorStoreIndex` is adept at addressing queries that pertain to specific contexts within a single document or a collection of documents. However, user queries in real-world scenarios can be intricate, often requiring the retrieval of context from multiple documents to provide an answer. In such situations, a straightforward VectorStoreIndex might not suffice. Instead, breaking down the complex user queries into sub-queries can yield more accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how the `SubQuestionQueryEngine` can be leveraged to tackle complex queries by generating and addressing sub-queries."

      "\u001b[1;3;38;2;11;159;203m[paul_graham_vector_query_engine] A: Paul Graham started Y Combinator as a result of a convergence of three thoughts: his desire to stop procrastinating about angel investing, his wish to collaborate with Robert and Trevor on projects, and his frustration with VCs who took too long to make decisions. He decided to start his own investment firm, where he would fund it, his wife Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and they could get Robert and Trevor as partners. The aim was to make seed investments and help startups in the same way they had been helped when they were starting out.\n",
