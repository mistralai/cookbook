    "A `VectorStoreIndex` is designed to handle queries related to specific contexts, while a `SummaryIndex` is optimized for answering summarization queries. However, in real-world scenarios, user queries may require either context-specific responses or summarizations. To address this, the system must effectively route user queries to the appropriate index to provide relevant answers.\n",
