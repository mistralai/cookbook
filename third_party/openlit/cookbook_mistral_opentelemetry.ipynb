    "This cookbook will cover the process of integrating OpenLIT with the Mistral SDK. A straightforward guide demonstrates how adding a single line of code can seamlessly enable OpenLIT to track various metrics, including cost, tokens, prompts, responses, and all chat/completion activities from the Mistral SDK using OpenTelemetry.\n",

    "## About OpenLIT\n",
    "\n",
    "**OpenLIT** is an open-source AI Engineering tool that help you to simplify your AI development workflow, especially for Generative AI and LLMs. It streamlines essential tasks like experimenting with LLMs, organizing and versioning prompts, and securely handling API keys. With just one line of code, you can enable **OpenTelemetry-native** observability, offering full-stack monitoring that includes LLMs, vector databases, and GPUs. This enables developers to confidently build AI features and applications, transitioning smoothly from testing to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project proudly follows and maintains the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) with the OpenTelemetry community, consistently updating to align with the latest standards in Observability."

To set up a detailed monitoring environment, this guide outlines how to deploy OpenLIT and direct all traces and metrics there.
