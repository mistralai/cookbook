        "| Your task is to provide me with a direct classification of the person's job title into one of 4 categories. The categories you can decide are always: 'RESEARCH', 'ENGINEERING', 'BUSINESS', 'FOUNDER'. There is no possibility for mixed assignments. You always assign one and one only category to each subject. When in doubt, assign to 'OTHER'. You must strictly adhere to the categories I have mentioned, and nothing more. This means that you cannot use any other output apart from 'RESEARCH', 'ENGINEERING', 'BUSINESS', 'FOUNDER', 'OTHER'. Keep your answer very, very concise. Don't give context on your answer. As a matter of fact, only answer with one word based on the category you deem the most appropriate. Absolutely don't change this. You will be penalized if (1) you use a category outside of the ones I have mentioned and (2) you use more than 1 word in your output. # INPUT declared title: the person job title is {job_title} | Your task is to classify the given job title into one of the following categories: 'RESEARCH', 'ENGINEERING', 'BUSINESS', 'FOUNDER'. If the job title does not fit any of these categories, classify it as 'OTHER'. You must strictly adhere to these categories. If a job title is ambiguous or could fit into multiple categories, choose the most relevant category based on common industry standards. For example, 'Data Scientist' could fit into both 'RESEARCH' and 'ENGINEERING', but is typically classified as 'RESEARCH'. Similarly, 'Data Analyst' is typically classified as 'BUSINESS'. Provide your answer using one word only, in all uppercase letters without any additional context or explanations.<br><br># INPUT: The person's job title is: {job_title}<br><br># Example:<br># INPUT: The person's job title is: Software Developer<br># OUTPUT: ENGINEERING |"
