First, we will generate critiques about the articles making use of guides that our model should respect and use as reference. Then, using these critiques, we will produce new, refined articles. The goal is to create a dataset that includes at least the original article and its refined version, which could potentially be used to fine-tune a model in the future or other purposes."
