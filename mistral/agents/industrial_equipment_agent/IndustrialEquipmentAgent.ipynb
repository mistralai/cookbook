        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "In industrial settings, engineers and technicians often struggle to manage and retrieve comprehensive information about various equipment. This information is scattered across technical manuals, maintenance logs, safety protocols, troubleshooting guides, and parts inventories. The fragmented nature of this data makes it difficult to access and utilize effectively, leading to inefficiencies and potential safety risks. This problem requires an intelligent, adaptive solution to provide real-time, context-aware responses to queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Proposed Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these challenges, we propose an agentic workflow that integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a database querying system (FunctionCalling). This solution leverages LLMs (including structured output mechanism), embedding models and structured data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and precise information. The workflow is orchestrated by multiple agents, each with a specific role:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **RAGAgent**: Utilizes LLMs and Embedding models to retrieve and generate contextually relevant information from technical documents.\n",
        "2. **DatabaseQueryAgent**: Handles precise and structured data retrieval from databases containing maintenance logs, technical specifications, parts inventories, and compliance records.\n",
        "3. **WorkflowOrchestrator**: Orchestrates interactions between the RAGSearchAgent and DatabaseAgent, ensuring seamless and efficient query resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Details\n",
        "\n",
        "### PDF Documents\n",
        "\n",
        "The PDF documents contain detailed information about various industrial equipment, categorized into:\n",
        "1. **Technical Manuals**: Operation and maintenance guides.\n",
        "2. **Maintenance Guides**: Routine and preventive maintenance tasks.\n",
        "3. **Troubleshooting Guides**: Solutions to common issues.\n",
        "4. **Safety Protocols**: Safety procedures and guidelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "The databases contain structured information that complements the PDF documents:\n",
        "1. **Compliance Database (`compliance_db`)**: Safety certifications and compliance statuses.\n",
        "2. **Maintenance Database (`maintenance_db`)**: Logs of maintenance activities.\n",
        "3. **Technical Specifications Database (`technical_specifications_db`)**: Detailed technical specifications.\n",
        "4. **Parts Inventory and Compatibility Database (`parts_inventory_compatibility_db`)**: Information on parts, compatibility, and inventory status.\n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating these datasets, the proposed agentic workflow aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient system for managing and retrieving industrial equipment information, ensuring that engineers and technicians have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Check the Program**:\n",
            "   - Ensure that the CNC program is correct and free of errors. Even minor errors in the code can lead to significant inaccuracies in machining.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Inspect the Tooling**:\n",
            "   - Verify that the correct tools are being used and that they are in good condition. Worn or damaged tools can cause inaccuracies. Replace tools as needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Verify the Setup**:\n",
            "   - Check the workpiece setup to ensure it is secure and correctly positioned. Any movement or misalignment can lead to machining inaccuracies.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Calibrate the Machine**:\n",
            "   - Regular calibration of the machine's axes and spindles can help maintain accuracy. If the machine hasn't been calibrated recently, it may be time to do so.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Check for Wear and Tear**:\n",
            "   - Inspect the machine for any signs of wear and tear, such as worn bearings or guides. These components can affect the machine's accuracy over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Environmental Factors**:\n",
            "   - Ensure that the machining environment is stable. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and vibration can affect the machine's performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Machine Maintenance**:\n",
            "   - Regular maintenance, including lubrication and cleaning, can help prevent inaccuracies. Ensure that the machine is well-maintained and that all scheduled maintenance tasks are completed on time.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Software and Firmware**:\n",
            "   - Ensure that the machine's software and firmware are up-to-date. Outdated software can sometimes cause inaccuracies.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Backlash Compensation**:\n",
            "   - Check the backlash compensation settings. Incorrect settings can lead to inaccuracies, especially in high-precision machining.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Consult the Manual**:\n",
