        "\n",
        "Companies earnings calls provide critical insights into a company's performance, strategy, and future outlook. However, these transcripts are lengthy, dense, and cover diverse topics - making it challenging to extract targeted insights efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Quarterly earnings calls provide critical insights into company performance, strategies, and outlook, but extracting meaningful analysis presents significant challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Earnings call transcripts are lengthy and dense, often spanning 20+ pages of complex financial discussions\n",
        "Key insights are scattered throughout the text without clear organization.\n",
        "- Different stakeholders need different types of information (financial metrics, strategic initiatives, risk factors).\n",
        "- Cross-quarter analysis requires manually tracking evolving narratives across multiple calls.\n",
        "- Traditional manual analysis is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to missing important details.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "For investors, analysts, and business leaders, comprehensive earnings call analysis delivers significant value:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Time Efficiency: Reduce analysis time from days to minutes\n",
        "- Decision Support: Provide structured insights for investment and strategic decisions\n",
        "- Comprehensive Coverage: Ensure no important insights are missed\n",
        "- Consistent Analysis: Apply the same analytical rigor to every transcript\n",
        "- Trend Detection: Identify patterns across quarters that might otherwise go unnoticed\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "The Earnings Call Analysis Orchestrator transforms how earnings calls are processed through a multi-agent workflow that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Extracts insights from quarterly transcripts using specialized analysis agents\n",
        "2. Delivers both comprehensive reports and targeted query responses\n",
        "3. Identifies trends and patterns across quarters\n",
        "4. Maintains a structured knowledge base of earnings insights\n",
        "\n",
        "## Specialized Analysis Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "Our system employs specialized agents working in coordination to deliver comprehensive analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Financial Agent:** Extracts revenue figures, profit margins, growth metrics, and other quantifiable performance indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategic Agent:** Identifies product roadmaps, market expansions, partnerships, and long-term vision initiatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sentiment Agent:** Evaluates management's confidence, tone, and enthusiasm across different business segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Risk Agent:** Detects supply chain, market, regulatory challenges, and assesses their severity and mitigation plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Competitor Agent:** Tracks competitive positioning, market share discussions, and differentiation strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Temporal Agent:** Analyzes trends across quarters to identify business trajectory and evolving priorities.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Workflow Orchestration\n",
        "\n",
        "The orchestrator serves as the central coordinator that:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Efficiently processes and caches transcript text using advanced OCR\n",
        "- Activates specialized agents based on analysis needs\n",
        "Stores structured insights in a centralized knowledge base\n",
        "- Generates comprehensive reports with executive summaries, sectional analyses, and outlook\n",
        "- Answers specific queries by leveraging relevant insights across quarters\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "For demonstration purposes, we use NVIDIA's quarterly earnings call transcripts from 2025:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\n",
        "- Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\n",
        "- Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\n",
        "- Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\n",
        "\n",
        "These transcripts contain discussions of financial results, strategic initiatives, market conditions, and forward-looking statements by NVIDIA's management team and their interactions with financial analysts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mistral AI Models\n",
        "\n",
        "For our implementation, we use Mistral AI's LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "`mistral-small-latest`: Used for general analysis and response generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "`mistral-large-latest`: Used for structured output generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "`mistral-ocr-latest`: Used for PDF transcript extraction and processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This modular approach enables both in-depth report generation and targeted question answering while maintaining efficiency through selective agent activation and insights reuse."
