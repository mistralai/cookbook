        "- **LLM chaining**: In this example, we chain two LLMs in a sequence, where the output from the first LLM serves as the input for the second LLM. The method of chaining LLMs can be adapted to suit your specific use cases. For instance, you might choose to employ three LLMs in a chain, where the output of two LLMs is funneled into the third LLM. While LLM chaining offers flexibility, it's important to consider that it may result in additional API calls and potentially increased costs.\n",
