    "## Introduction\n",
    "The primary objective of this cookbook is to illustrate how to effectively use the lastest [Mistral Large 2](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/#premier-models) model to conduct **web searches** and incorporate relevant sources into your responses. A common challenge with chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is their **tendency to hallucinate sources or improperly format URLs**. Mistral's advanced capabilities address these issues, ensuring accurate and reliable information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mistral's Web Search Capabilities\n",
    "The new Mistral model `mistral-large-latest` integrates web search capabilities, allowing it to **reference sources accurately in its responses**. This feature enables you to retrieve the source content and present it correctly in your responses, enhancing the reliability and credibility of the information provided. By leveraging Mistral's advanced natural language processing and web search integration, you can build more robust and trustworthy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![image info](../../images/reference_rag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step description of the process depicted in the image above:\n",
    "1. **Query Initiation**: The process begins with a user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Calling with Mistral Large**: The query is processed by the Mistral Large model, which identifies that it needs to perform a function call to gather more information. This step involves determining the appropriate tool to use for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Identification**: The Mistral model identifies the relevant tool for the query, which in this case is `web_search_wikipedia`. The tool has the user query as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wikipedia Search**: The tool is called and performs a search on Wikipedia using the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extract Relevant Chunks**: The results from the Wikipedia search are processed to extract relevant chunks of information. These chunks are then prepared to be used as references in the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Answer with References**: The chat history is sent to the Mistral Large model which uses the extracted chunks to generate a final answer. The answer includes references to the Wikipedia articles, ensuring that the information provided is accurate and well-sourced.\n",
